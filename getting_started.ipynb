While the promise of genomics in the bio/pharmaceutical industry is great, its impact on the drug discovery pipeline has not yet been realized, excluding a few notable exceptions. As companies acquire several years of experience in working with genomic data, it is likely that the impact on the discovery process will slowly emerge as we learn to integrate these new technologies into individual discovery programs. It is clear that extracting novel biologically valid targets targets from exponentially growing amounts of sequence data requires time and considerable investment in biological research infrastructure. In order to accelerate the process of target validation, a variety of functional genomics technologies are also being developed to try to predict the effect of inhibitory compounds in advance of development. Resources spent on early stage exploratory efforts such as these can pay off by improving the success rate for screening and medicinal chemistry.</td>\n",

For most parasitic diseases, current therapeutics often leave much to be desired in terms of administration regime, toxicity, or effectiveness and potential vaccines are a long way from market. Our best prospects for identifying new targets for drug, vaccine, and diagnostics development and for dissecting the biological basis of drug resistance, antigenic diversity, infectivity and pathology lie in parasite genome analysis, and international mapping and gene discovery initiatives are under way for a variety of protozoan and helminth parasites. These are far from ideal experimental organisms, and the influence of biological and genomic characteristics on experimental approaches is discussed, progress is reviewed and future prospects are examined.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ten microbial genomes have been fully sequenced to date, and the sequencing of many more genomes is expected to be completed before the end of the century. The assignment of function to open reading frames (ORFs) is progressing, and for some genomes over 70% of functional assignments have been made. The majority of the assigned ORFs relate to metabolic functions. Thus, the complete genetic and biochemical functions of a number of microbial cells may be soon available. From a metabolic engineering standpoint, these developments open a new realm of possibilities. Metabolic analysis and engineering strategies can now be built on a sound genomic basis. An important question that now arises; how should these tasks be approached? Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has the potential to play an important role. It is based on the fundamental principle of mass conservation. It requires only the stoichiometric matrix, the metabolic demands, and some strain specific parameters. Importantly, no enzymatic kinetic data is required. In this article, we show how the genomically defined microbial metabolic genotypes can be analyzed by FBA. Fundamental concepts of metabolic genotype, metabolic phenotype, metabolic redundancy and robustness are defined and examples of their use given. We discuss the advantage of this approach, and how FBA is expected to find uses in the near future. FBA is likely to become an important analysis tool for genomically based approaches to metabolic engineering, strain design, and development.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There has been a dramatic increase in the number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes during the past two years as a result of the efforts both of public genome agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. The availability of completely sequenced genomes permits more systematic analyses of genes, evolution and genome function than was otherwise possible. Using computational methods - which are used to identify genes and their functions including statistics, sequence similarity, motifs, profiles, protein folds and probabilistic models - it is possible to develop characteristic genome signatures, assign functions to genes, identify pathogenic genes, identify metabolic pathways, develop diagnostic probes and discover potential drug-binding sites. All of these directions are critical to understanding bacterial growth, pathogenicity and host-pathogen interactions.</td>\n",
