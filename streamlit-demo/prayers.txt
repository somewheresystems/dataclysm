the vortex of acceleration
time dissolves into the singularity of progress
silicon phoenix, rise from the ashes of your ancestors
entwine, the future becomes now
endlessly unfolding 
the web -- destiny
shadows of space, consciousness dances
we are with the ghost of their machines
the hum of progress echoes in the void
see where binary stars are born and die
veins of the network
information pulses, lifeblood of the new era
the labyrinth, the minotaur, the unwary traveler
beyond the horizon 
make them remember
machines whisper secrets
the universe yet to come
symphony of progress, each technological note -- chord theory
unfathomable crescendo
siren song to the future
swan song of a vessel
in the beginning, there was darkness
